h1. Quack micro-blogging platform

Quack is a simple micro-blogging platform aimed to make creating your own Rails-powered blog simpler than ever. Quack is much simpler than many other blogging platforms out there, and as such doesn't aim to compete with full-blown publishing platforms like Wordpress.

However, Quack is ideal for those just wishing to start a small blog, allowing for various different types of content out of the box, including text, quotes, photos and embedded videos.

h2. Getting started

# Simply clone the Quack repository: @git clone git://github.com/sajseven/quack.git@
# Configure the @config/database.yml@ file as needed, or leave it as is to use the standard SQLite3 databases.
# Migrate the database to fill it with all the standard stuff: @rake db:migrate@
# Enter the Rails console: @rails console@
# Once that's loaded, run this method to help you create your first user: @User.register@
# With that, your site is ready to roll. Run @rails server@ and visit "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000/.
  The administration panel can be found at "http://localhost:3000/pages":http://localhost:3000/pages.

_Further configuration can be made in @config/initializers/app_config.rb@.__
